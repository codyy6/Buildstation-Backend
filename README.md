# Buildstation-Backend
Run the python script below for the backend to operate

python .\app.py

After running the backend, only interact with the frontend processes. Do take note that for the contribute function, only the author has the access to view the uploaded file.
Thank you.

For the current system, it can only do verification on the Re-entrancy vulnerabilities. The main reason for this issue is because of the data is extremely large plus the processing speed is taking very long to operate. For a more robust and complete system, it would take a lot more longer to finish it.
